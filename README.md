# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis

### Overview
This project is a case study analyzing the Cyclistic bike-share dataset using R in a Jupyter Notebook. The primary goal is to explore the differences in usage patterns between casual riders and annual members. By understanding how each group interacts with the bike-share system, we can derive insights that could help improve Cyclistic’s services and user experience.

### About the Dataset
The dataset contains information on bike trips, including:

- Trip start and end times
- User type (casual vs. member)
- Rideable type (classic vs. electric)
- Station locations

The data was sourced from [Cyclistic’s public bike-share data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/skyetran66/divvy-cyclistic-data-2024).

### Objective

The main objective of this analysis is to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.

### Files Included:
- **`case_study.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis, including data cleaning, visualization, and insights.

### Key Insights
- Annual members have a consistent and commuter-focused usage pattern, riding frequently on weekdays with shorter, purpose-driven trips.
- Casual riders display a seasonal and recreational usage pattern, with peak activity in summer and on weekends, and generally taking longer trips.
- Classic bikes are the preferred choice for both user groups.
- Targeted membership promotions during peak summer months could encourage casual riders to convert into annual members.
